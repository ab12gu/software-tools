# Docker

Creates a virtual environment of your OS to allow deployment of software seamlessly. 

It tends to be faster than running a entire virtual machine because it automizes using a single linux instance; however, would be slower if you can build to your OS natively.

## Breakdown

Consists of 3 components:

1. **Docker daemon**, *dockerd*, manages Docker containers.
2. **Objects**: Docker objects are used to assemble an application in Docker.
3. **Registries**: A Docker registry is a repository for Docker images 

## Installation

- Desktop [Installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

## Tools

- **Docker Compose**: running multi-container Docker applications, but not necessary if application only uses a single container. 
- **Docker Swarm**
- **Docker Volume**
